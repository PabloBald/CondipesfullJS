# CondipesfullJS

This is an improved JS version of CondiPes page, it does the same, but have a lot of improved things, 
it was a JavaScript practice that helps me to improve a lot on JS and understand new concepts. 

Almost all elements were created in JS, it gives me a lot of practice on how to create elements in a dinamic way.
